I started diving into XM Cloud at the end of 2022, did a lot of research in the beginning in 2023, and wrote a lot of blog posts describing my adventures. But there was one big problem: customer did not dare to take the step yet.

One of my findings at that time was that there was a lot of work to do to make XM Cloud a product of its own. It still leaned heavy on the Content Editor to do the configuration work that was required, but the Content Editor was just the old XM beast with all its confusing non-headless information in the way making it very difficult to find your way through the XM Cloud required elements. There was a first preview version of XM Cloud Components, without any documentation, and there was no support for Forms.

In the mean time a lot has happened. Documentation on XM Cloud improved significantly, making it easier for users to navigate and utilize its features. Also developer documentation improved, missing features were introduced, like support for Azure DevOps as source control system, and the system looks like a more grown up product. Additionally, Components is now part of the product and documented, and support for Forms has been introduced, further enhancing the user experience and functionality of XM Cloud.

Time to take a fresh look. And because I have a very bad memory, one of the big reasons why I blog - it's my external memory, I will be documenting my new findings and experiences with the updated XM Cloud here. 

 So, stay tuned for my upcoming posts as I delve deeper into the enhanced capabilities of XM Cloud.
