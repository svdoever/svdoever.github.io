It is really cool to see that the XM Cloud documentation is getting there! The first entrypoint is https://doc.sitecore.com/xmc/, which points out some highlighted sections in the user-oriented documentation (**Working with XM Cloud**) and highlighted section in the developer-oriented documentation (**Developing XM Cloud solutions** + **Tooling and integrations**):

The main entry points are however:

- [User documentation](https://doc.sitecore.com/xmc/en/users/xm-cloud/sitecore-experience-manager-cloud.html)
  - [XM Cloud Pages](https://doc.sitecore.com/xmc/en/users/xm-cloud/create-webpages-with-xm-cloud-pages.html) - the new Experience Editor
  - [XM Cloud Explorer](https://doc.sitecore.com/xmc/en/users/xm-cloud/create-content-with-xm-cloud-explorer.html) - the new content editor for end users
- [Developer documentation](https://doc.sitecore.com/xmc/en/developers/xm-cloud/sitecore-experience-manager-cloud.html)

The good thing is that this is a copy of the Sitecore XM documentation, but tailered to everything XM Cloud. 

Besides these two documentation sets there is also documentation on:

- [Sitecore Cloud Portal](https://doc.sitecore.com/portal/en/developers/sitecore-cloud-portal/introduction-to-the-sitecore-cloud-portal.html) - the management portal for XM Cloud projects and environments  


In the Sitecore Learning portal there is also a learning path [XM Cloud for Technical Users](https://learning.sitecore.com/learn/lp/36/XM%2520Cloud%2520for%2520Technical%2520Users), currently consisting of three courses:
- Introduction to Experience Manager Cloud
- XM Cloud Command Line Interface (CLI)
- XM Cloud Deploy Application
