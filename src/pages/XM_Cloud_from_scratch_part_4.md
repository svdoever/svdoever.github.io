spoiler: In the XM Cloud from scratch we created a project, environment, and site, and I did my setup for development. But in the meantime things changed! We now have JSS 22.1, and a new version of the headstart for Next.js.

In my post [XM Cloud - from scratch - Part 3 - Starting with development](https://www.sergevandenoever.nl/XM_Cloud_from_scratch_part_3) I described how to start with developing for XM Cloud by installing all required tooling on your machine, cloning the repository created by XM Cloud Deploy on GitHub, run `npm install` and execute `npm run start:connected`. The project created was with JSS version 22.0.0, and in the meantime version 20.1 came out.

A "bump up" of a minor version sounds like not a big deal, but version 20.1 brings us some interesting features
