date: '2019-01-17'
spoiler: That mandatory first blog post on my own "blogging platform". After blogging for years on http://weblogs.asp.net/soever and some endeavors with the Medium blogging platform.

There is always that first blog post when you start a weblog. Well, this is THAT post.
I have been blogging (on and off) for years. I started on [weblogs.asp.net](http://weblogs.asp.net/soever) in 2003, a hosting platform provided by Microsoft - also hosting the big Microsoft names like [Scott Guthrie](https://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu). But the platform is ageing, and writing blog posts in the web interface is not the best experience.

I tried [blog posts on Medium](https://medium.com/@svdoever), and hated the editing experience, especially with code... everything must be gist on Github, because code formatting within Medium is terrible. But including long gists results in a really slow editing experience. But the most important reason to leave Medium is a post on an e-mail list by [Joel Hooks](http://joelhooks.com) of [EggHead.io](https://egghead.io/) who wrote in a post called [building YOUR brand as a developer...](https://www.getdrip.com/deliveries/fseddnphjsr6souec1vf?__s=dx85yvypxe528hsunssi):

> Giving Medium words in exchange for exposure is hardly a fair trade.
> If I write something, I want it to be a “Joel” post, not a “Medium” post.
> Nobody ever says “oh, hey, did you see that article Joel wrote on Medium?” They say, “Did you see that Medium post?”

and 

> These are your deeply-held opinions that took years for you to develop.
> You own those thoughts, so you should own where you air them.
> We — and I mean us, the software developers — need to make a stand and bring back the personal blog.
> We need to own our work, our thoughts, our tutorials, our content.
> And as developers, we’re uniquely positioned to do it.

So this the start of my first self-owned blogging platform. I'm using [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org), and "stole" the initial code from Dan Abramov's weblog [overreacted.io](https://overreacted.io). Thanks Dan!

Joel Hooks also created a great [Gatsby-based weblog starter](https://github.com/eggheadio/gatsby-starter-egghead-blog),  I will definitely steal some of the ideas from his code-base - I love the MDX idea!

So let's get started with blogging! It has been a while...
