title: Weblog deployment to a static Microsoft Azure website
date: '2019-01-18'
spoiler: This weblog is created with GatsbyJS and after build results in a static website that can be hosted anywhere. I host my weblog on a Microsoft Azure static website. In this post I provide links to how to set up an Azure static website, and how to automate the deployment based on commits to the Github repository.
---

My  weblog is hosted in a Git repository on Github. Github is bought by Microsoft, and now Github provides integration with Azure and its pipelines for build and deploy. This integration can be enabled through the [Azure Pipelines app](https://github.com/marketplace/azure-pipelines) at the Github marketplace.

After setting up and configuring the Azure Pipelines app for your Github account move over to https://dev.azure.com. In the new configured Azure DevOps organization you can setup new projects.

There are no build pipelines configured yet.

When creating a new build pipeline the first question is: where is your repo. In my case the repo is hosted on Github.

![Azure DevOps select repo](weblog-deployment-to-static-azure-website/AzureDevOpsSelectRepo.png)

Authorize yourself, and select the repository to use in the deployment. The final step is to configure the build pipeline. This is done though a YAML file called ```azure-pipelines.yml``` that will be stored in the root of the Github repository. Because the project to deploy is a Node application the information in the documentation
[Build, test, and deploy JavaScript and Node.js apps in Azure Pipelines](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/pipelines/languages/javascript?view=vsts&tabs=yaml) describes the possible configuration settings that can be made.

![Azure DevOps build pipeline configuration](weblog-deployment-to-static-azure-website\AzureDevOpsConfigureBuildPipeline.png)

azure-pipelines.yml:
```yaml{}
trigger:
- master

pool:
  vmImage: 'Ubuntu-16.04'

steps:
- task: NodeTool@0
  inputs:
    versionSpec: '10.x'
  displayName: 'Install Node.js'

- script: |
    npm install
    npm run azure-build
  displayName: 'npm install and build'

- task: PublishBuildArtifacts@1
  inputs:
    PathtoPublish: '$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/public'
```

In the above build pipeline configuration there are a few important elements:

1. The script tag does an ```npm install``` and an ```npm run azure-build``` which actually just calls ```gatsby build```. The result of this build is a static website with all blog posts in the folder ```public```.
2. The ```PublishBuildArtifacts``` tasks selects as path to publish only the contents on this public folder. Note that if the resulting artifacts a folder ```drop``` is created containing the contents of the public folder.

We now have a build result which must be deployed. The website is deployed as a static website on an Azure storage account, as described in the documentation [Static website hosting in Azure Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-static-website). Important for the next step is that when you create a static website on the storage (only one static website per storage account), the website is stored in the container ```$web```. In the case of my weblog the resulting website is [https://personalsvdoever.z6.web.core.windows.net](https://personalsvdoever.z6.web.core.windows.net).

The following step is the release pipeline for deployment of the build artifacts to the the static website.

![Azure DevOps release pipeline](weblog-deployment-to-static-azure-website/AzureDevOpsReleasePipeline.png)

This release pipeline is triggered by a new build result, and requires only one task in the stage that is renamed to **To static website**.

![Azure DevOps release pipeline filecopy](weblog-deployment-to-static-azure-website/AzureDevOpsReleaseFileCopy.png)

Import in the configuration of the **Azure File Copy** task is that the we need to take the source files from the ```drop``` folder and copy them to the container ```$web```.

One issue with the static web sites on Azure storage is that they support http only. This can be solved using an Azure CDN as described in [Tutorial: Use Azure CDN to enable a custom domain with SSL for a static website](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-static-website-custom-domain).

My first take on selecting a CDN was taking the Microsoft standard
CDN. The issue that I faced was that when I updated an article the
CDN did not reflect these changes. Expiration of items on the CDN
are controlled by `Cache-Control` headers as explained in the
article [Manage expiration of web content in Azure CDN](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cdn/cdn-manage-expiration-of-cloud-service-content). Because I'm running from a static web site hosted on Azure blob
storage I don't have a web server in between where I can control
these headers like I can do on for example IIS. The other CDN
offerings on Azure (Verizon, Akamai) give you more control to 
override caching based on for example file extensions. I first tried
the Verizon offering which let you control these settings in a 
separate and incomprehensible "manage" interface. After struggling
for a while I tried the Akamai offering of the CDN which has the
Azure management screens as described in the above mentioned article
so I could make all pages cache for 1 minute except for .js, .css 
and .json files which get a new unique url after each site 
generation and can be cached fr a year.  


The CDN for this weblog is running on [https://svdoever.azureedge.net](https://svdoever.azureedge.net). The custom domain name [www.sergevandenoever.nl](https://www.sergevandenoever.nl) points to this url.
